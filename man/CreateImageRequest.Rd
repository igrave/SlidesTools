}
\arguments{
\item{objectId}{(string)
A user-supplied object ID. If you specify an ID, it must be unique among all pages and page elements in the presentation. The ID must start with an alphanumeric character or an underscore (matches regex \verb{[a-zA-Z0-9_]}); remaining characters may include those as well as a hyphen or colon (matches regex \verb{[a-zA-Z0-9_-:]}). The length of the ID must not be less than 5 or greater than 50. If you don't specify an ID, a unique one is generated.}

\item{elementProperties}{(\link{PageElementProperties})
The element properties for the image. When the aspect ratio of the provided size does not match the image aspect ratio, the image is scaled and centered with respect to the size in order to maintain the aspect ratio. The provided transform is applied after this operation. The PageElementProperties.size property is optional. If you don't specify the size, the default size of the image is used. The PageElementProperties.transform property is optional. If you don't specify a transform, the image will be placed at the top-left corner of the page.}

\item{url}{(string)
The image URL. The image is fetched once at insertion time and a copy is stored for display inside the presentation. Images must be less than 50 MB in size, can't exceed 25 megapixels, and must be in one of PNG, JPEG, or GIF formats. The provided URL must be publicly accessible and up to 2 KB in length. The URL is saved with the image, and exposed through the Image.source_url field.}
