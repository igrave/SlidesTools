\usage{
CreateSlideRequest(
  objectId = NULL,
  insertionIndex = NULL,
  slideLayoutReference = NULL,
  placeholderIdMappings = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{objectId}{(string)
A user-supplied object ID. If you specify an ID, it must be unique among all pages and page elements in the presentation. The ID must start with an alphanumeric character or an underscore (matches regex \verb{[a-zA-Z0-9_]}); remaining characters may include those as well as a hyphen or colon (matches regex \verb{[a-zA-Z0-9_-:]}). The ID length must be between 5 and 50 characters, inclusive. If you don't specify an ID, a unique one is generated.}

\item{insertionIndex}{(integer)
The optional zero-based index indicating where to insert the slides. If you don't specify an index, the slide is created at the end.}

\item{slideLayoutReference}{(\link{LayoutReference})
Layout reference of the slide to be inserted, based on the \emph{current master}, which is one of the following: - The master of the previous slide index. - The master of the first slide, if the insertion_index is zero. - The first master in the presentation, if there are no slides. If the LayoutReference is not found in the current master, a 400 bad request error is returned. If you don't specify a layout reference, the slide uses the predefined \code{BLANK} layout.}

\item{placeholderIdMappings}{(list of \link{LayoutPlaceholderIdMapping} objects)
An optional list of object ID mappings from the placeholder(s) on the layout to the placeholders that are created on the slide from the specified layout. Can only be used when \code{slide_layout_reference} is specified.}
